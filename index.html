                <h2> Introduction to Web Design </h2>
                <h4> October 1, 2022 by Sabrina </h4>

                <p> The term "web design" describes the layout of websites that are 
                    seen online. Instead of software development, it typically refers 
                    to the user experience components of website development. The primary
                    focus of web design used to be creating websites for desktop browsers,
                    but from the middle of the 2010s, designing for mobile and tablet 
                    browsers has gained significance.A web designer is responsible for a 
                    website's look, feel, and occasionally even content. For instance, 
                    appearance refers to the colors, text, and images utilized.
                    Information's organization and categorization are referred to as 
                    its layout.</p>

                <p> Responsive and adaptive design are two of the most popular 
                    techniques for creating websites that function well on both 
                    desktop and mobile devices. In adaptive design, the website 
                    content is fixed in layout sizes that correspond to typical 
                    screen sizes, while in responsive design, information moves 
                    dynamically based on screen size. A layout that is as consistent 
                    as possible across devices is essential to preserving user engagement
                    and trust. Designers must be cautious when giving up control of 
                    how their work will appear because responsive design can be 
                    challenging in this area. While they might need to diversify their 
                    skill set if they are also in charge of the content, they will 
                    benefit from having complete control over the final output.</p>

                <h2> The beginnings of Web Design </h2>
                <h4> October 1, 2022 by Sabrina</h4> 

                <img class="img2" src="webdesign.png" alt="">

                <p> Tim Berners-Lee proposed developing a global hypertext project 
                    in 1989 when he was employed at CERN. This project would subsequently 
                    be known as the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web was created between
                    1991 and 1993. A basic line-mode web browser could be used to read 
                    HTML pages that included simply text. The Mosaic browser was 
                    developed by Eric Bina and Marc Andreessen in 1993. There were other 
                    browsers available at the time, but the majority of them were 
                    Unix-based and tended to be text-heavy. The use of graphics, audio, 
                    and other graphic design components had not been merged. It was 
                    broken by the Mosaic browser.</p>

                <p> Microsoft launched its first rival browser in 1996, complete with unique 
                    capabilities and HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style
                    sheets, which are now a crucial component of web design but were once 
                    considered a mysterious authoring technique. With earlier HTML versions, 
                    design options for websites were even more constrained. Many site designers
                    had to use intricate table structures to achieve complex designs. The W3C 
                    first released CSS in 1996 to support presentation and layout. This
                    enhanced web accessibility by allowing HTML code to be semantic rather 
                    than both semantic and presentational.</p>
